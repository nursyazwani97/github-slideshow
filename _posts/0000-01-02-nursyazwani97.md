No one can help us walk the road we're taking. While we may get lost and feel lonely along the way, we cannot give up halfway through. Especially when there is one thing that we love, it will drive us to keep going. The journey will be tumultuous because nothing in this world is easy, but our love for that one thing we're chasing is bigger than anything else. We get used to all of the hardship,pain and sufferings, even the resentment, that comes with it. - Jackson Wang, Alone
